    "In this notebook, you will implement the Fitted Q Iteration( (FQI) algorithm to solve the [CartPole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks will first cover the basics for using the Gymnasium library: how to instantiate an environment, step into it and collect training data from the FQI algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then learn how to implement step-by-step the FQI algorithm which is the predecessor of the [Deep Q-Network (DQN)](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/dqn.html) algorithm."

    "\n",
    "- `reset()` called at the beginning of an episode, it returns an observation and a dictionary with additional info (defaults to an empty dict)\n",
    "- `step(action)` called to take an action with the environment, it returns the next observation, the immediate reward, whether new state is a terminal state (episode is finished), whether the max number of timesteps is reached (episode is artificially finished), and additional information\n",
    "- (Optional) `render()` which allow to visualize the agent in action. Note that graphical interface does not work on google colab, so we cannot use it directly (we have to rely on `render_mode='rbg_array'` to retrieve an image of the scene).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, it also contains two useful properties:\n",
    "- `observation_space` which one of the gym spaces (`Discrete`, `Box`, ...) and describe the type and shape of the observation\n",
